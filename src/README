An SRTP Reverse Proxy

RTP -----------AES-CTR/HMAC-SHA1----------------> SRTP


1) Options in Makefile

CPU_AFFINITY: Set CPU Affinity
AFFINITY_1:    collector[0,1,2,3] forwarders[4,5,6,7]  +
AFFINITY_2:    collector[0,2,4,6] forwarders[1,3,5,7]  |--- gpu_worker[10]
AFFINITY_3:    collector[1,3,5,7] forwarders[2,4,6,8]  +
AFFINITY_4:    collector[1,2,3,4,..] forwarders[5,6,7,8,..] gpu_worker[0]

NOT_COLLECT:   do not copy the packets into buffer
NOT_GPU:       gpu just handles packets to forwarder, without processing with GPU
NOT_FORWARD:   forwarder just mark the buffer as available, without forwarding

COLLECTOR_PERFORMANCE_TEST:   evaluate the performance of collector, packets are copied to a specified location (Memcpy, destination without cache miss). GPU worker and Forwarder will not be launched.
NOT_GPU+NOT_FORWARD:          evaluate the performance of collector, each packet is copied to a differnt location (Memcpy, destination always cache miss).


2) Options in upro.c (config)

Through command line : ./upro -i 25 -n 4  # 25ms, cpu_worker_num = 4

I : GPU batch time
cpu_worker_num : Collector-Forwarder pair number
gpu_worker_num : Currently always 1
client_interface/server_interface : If they are the same, the proxy forwards packets through the port where it receives them. (xge0/xge1)
io_batch_num   : For IOEngine, packet number in each batch
